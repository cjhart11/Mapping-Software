# Teamwork Questionnaire for _Hunter Sullivan_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Slack, email or text are great for general stuff but call me if its an emergency. I'm available most days from 12pm-10pm.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * For us to communicate and work together as a team to get work done efficiently and on time.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I want to make sure im contributing to the conversation consistently and keep up to date with whats happening on the team.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Miscommunication, and general mistakes. We're students and are still learning, it happens we'll deal with it if it does.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * If we communicate about what needs to get done and that it gets done right and we shouldn't have an issue with this but
   sometimes theres not much you can do because mistakes happen and its not the end of the world. You learn more from mistakes anyways right?
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Everyone should do their part in order for the team to succeed to its fullest extent.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Not sure without knowing exactly what projects are gonna look lik but I would guess close to 20 or more possibly.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We can talk about what everyone is interested in or good at and go from there. We should try to schedule things as much as possible
   beginning of the sprint.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I would hope we would get a heads up as a team if someone couldn't get it done but if not we should talk as a team
   and if it continues then approach the TA's and/or Dave.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Then we can have an adult conversation about what needs to be changed and what doesn't.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * We should schedule things as much as possible and as long as we meet deadlines with the work 
   double/triple checked we should be ok.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I wouldn't be apposed to this at all. Probably more than one honestly.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * At least once or twice a sprint but if we need to meet more then we can make time.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Depends on the scale of the decision.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Have a conversation about it and go from there.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Depends on the definition of dominating. If its in a bad way or theyre doing too much work then ill say something most likely.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Do my best to keep things going smoothly and ask for help if its unreasonable.
