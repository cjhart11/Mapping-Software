#### What went well
* Throughout the sprint the team communicated effectively through Slack by consistently updating the team on our progress. If an issue arose it was promptly answered and fixed.
* With each team member having varying levels of experience we were able to complete each task fully. Each member's task was an essential part of completing this sprint. Everyone worked effectively and efficiently to meet our goals for sprint 1.

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* Having an online team member made it difficult to communicate as most of our communication was done in person. While we did consistently update the team member, his responses did not come in a timely manner. As a result we chose to take on extra tasks to meet our goal.
* Some tasks were unclear from the start. As the days moved on, we all started to realize that we did not fully understand some tasks. As a result we had to discuss each task as a team to make sure we all had a complete understanding of what needed to be done.

## Retrospective

#### What went well
* We constantly and effectively communicated as a team, there was no doubt that each member was committed to meet our goals. There was no doubt in a member progress due to the consistent updates. Once we created our tasks, we split the them evenly. No one member had extra work than the others. When a mistake was made it was swiftly corrected and explained thoroughly.
  
#### Potential improvements
* We need to improve our time estimation efforts. This sprint we laid out the tasks and did not estimate how long one would take. With how simple and short of a sprint it was, noticing any other improvements is difficult because we thought we did very well.

#### What we will change next time
* For sprint 2 we will not need to consider the actions of a less contributing team member as he is no longer in the course. We will also be more attentive to the github/version control process. Finally we will meet at least once at the beginning of each sprint to more thoroughly plan for upcoming tasks.
