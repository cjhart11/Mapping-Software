# Teamwork Questionnaire for Conor Hart

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   General questions email/slack would be best, text if it's an emergency. 7am-9pm 

1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   For us to work together as best as we can and have a functioning project that meets most of the requirements

1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester__
   I would like to get comfortable communicating with the team on issues I am running into with my own code or someone else's code that may be causing issues for the project. Everything up to this point has been mostly solo work.

1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals__ 
   Time management with everyones different schedules, struggles meeting deadlines, communication issues.

1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   I believe we should all strive for the "A", but lifes happens sometimes and something may come up where a "B" is all we can get.

1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   No, this should not happen

1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   It's hard to say without really knowing what the project is and what is expected for each sprint. So the amount of time will probably vary week to week. Previous semesters have been 20+ hours roughly for some projects so being in that ballpark is likely.

1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   Each sprint we will have to spend time breaking the requirements apart and assigning everyone a part of what needs to get done.

1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   I would hope they would let us know in advance so we can cover their part, but if it becomes a problem talking with Dave Matthews or the TA's will be the next step.

1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   Communicating your opinion to the group or to the individual and guiding them to the expectations that you are expecting and then find a middle ground.

1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   Work habits will differ between individuals, setting a schedule with deadlines is the solution. As long as they meet the deadline then it shouldnt be too much of an issue.

1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   Yes, as we go along this could always be adjusted

1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   Depends on how the current sprint is going, if we all think it is going well then we don't need to. But if people are having trouble then setting up more time could be helpful.

1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   No, I would think approval from 1-2 team members would be fine. Also depends how major of a change you are making.

1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   Get that one person's opinion, discuss their viewpoint as a group and try to come to an understanding that makes everyone happy.

1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   Depends on what dominating exactly means. If they are dominating at being a leader and we are near the end of a sprint I don't see any issues. But if they repeatedly do it then bringing it up with the group and allowing someone else to take on responsibilities is the most fair way. Dominating in a negative aspect as in bringing everything down to a halt, that will have to be taken care of much sooner.

1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   Bring it up with the team, see if we can distribute responsibilities in a more fair way.
